Experiment to extract a tree-shaken subset of the TypeScript compiler into a library.

All build artifacts are committed to git so you can see how it works via GitHub.

# Usage:

Customize list of sourcefiles and exports in `build.sh`

Then `yarn && yarn exec ./build.sh`

Ignore the TS compile errors.
